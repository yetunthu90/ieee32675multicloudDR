# The ISO/IEC/IEEE 32675 Standard for Multi-Cloud Disaster Recovery

## Background / Overview

Multi-cloud architectures are increasingly adopted by enterprises to optimize cost, leverage diverse features across cloud providers, and enhance reliability and disaster recovery (DR) capabilities. However, implementing disaster recovery in multi-cloud environments presents several challenges, including:

- Configuration complexity  
- Data consistency  
- Security concerns  
- Varying pricing models

The ISO/IEC/IEEE 32675 standard provides a systematic framework to address these challenges, promoting consistent, reliable, and interoperable DR practices in multi-cloud environments.

This research aims to **regularize disaster recovery practices** in multi-cloud contexts using the ISO/IEC/IEEE 32675 standard. It seeks to define recommended approaches, ensure consistency, and address interoperability issues.

## Problem Statement

This research investigates whether the ISO/IEC/IEEE 32675 standard effectively addresses the challenges of multi-cloud disaster recovery and enhances overall DR effectiveness.

> By standardizing disaster recovery practices, organizations can adopt more uniform, reliable strategies across multiple cloud environments.

## Research Aim & Objectives

**Aim:**  
To regularize disaster recovery practices in multi-cloud environments based on the ISO/IEC/IEEE 32675 standard.

**Objectives:**  
- Analyze the key principles and requirements of ISO/IEC/IEEE 32675 applicable to multi-cloud DR.  
- Compare industry implementations of multi-cloud DR with and without the standard to evaluate its impact.  
- Identify challenges in adopting the standard and propose practical implementation approaches.

## Initial Research Question

> **How does the ISO/IEC/IEEE 32675 Standard regularize Multi-Cloud Disaster Recovery?**

---

## Ethical Considerations

This research does **not** require ethical approval, as it utilizes publicly available datasets, industry documentation, and cloud provider case studies.

---

## Research Approach

### 1. Identifying the Research Question

- How can the standard be applied across cloud providers from a **standardization** perspective?  
- How does the standard improve **interoperability**, cross-cloud data consistency, and failover processes?

### 2. Literature Review

- Review ISO/IEC/IEEE 32675 documentation and its DR guidelines.  
- Examine existing DR frameworks and challenges prior to standardization.  
- Analyze academic papers and industry whitepapers on multi-cloud DR standardization.  
- Compare multi-cloud provider-specific DR strategies with the ISO/IEC/IEEE 32675 standard.

### 3. Qualitative & Quantitative Analysis

- **Qualitative:** Case studies of organizations using multi-cloud DR with/without the standard.  
- **Quantitative:** Evaluate Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) in DR scenarios.

### 4. Evaluation & Findings

- Assess whether ISO/IEC/IEEE 32675 improves DR effectiveness.  
- Identify gaps, limitations, and real-world adoption barriers.

### 5. Conclusion & Recommendations

- Summarize how the standard supports DR regularization in multi-cloud setups.  
- Provide actionable recommendations for implementation.

## Artefact & Measurement

**Artefact:**  
A **multi-cloud disaster recovery simulation framework** showcasing DR strategies **with and without** ISO/IEC/IEEE 32675 compliance. It will simulate:

- Cloud failover scenarios  
- Data recovery timelines

**Measurement Criteria:**

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Speed of system recovery post-failure.  
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Data loss during failure.  
- **Manual Intervention Frequency:** Number of times human intervention is needed.  
- **Interoperability Score:** Effectiveness of DR across providers.  
- **Compliance Metrics:** Alignment with ISO/IEC/IEEE 32675.

## Comparison with Existing Research

Prior work (e.g., *Designing a Robust Multi-Cloud DevOps Strategy for Kubernetes Disaster Recovery* by Shashank Arvind Gokhale) focuses on:

- Cloud-native tools  
- Vendor-specific DR solutions  
- Open-source frameworks for GCP and Azure

**Gaps in existing research:**

- Lack of standardization  
- Limited exploration of ISO/IEC/IEEE 32675  
- Weak focus on interoperability

**This research differs by:**

- Applying ISO/IEC/IEEE 32675 to multi-cloud disaster recovery  
- Focusing on **standardization**, **interoperability**, and **vendor-neutral** strategies  
- Proposing a measurable simulation framework

## Summary

By examining and implementing the ISO/IEC/IEEE 32675 standard, this research intends to regularize and improve multi-cloud disaster recovery practices. It emphasizes standardization, practical implementation, and cross-cloud interoperability for enhanced business continuity.
